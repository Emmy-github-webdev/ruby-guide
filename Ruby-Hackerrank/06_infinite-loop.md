This is a wonderful exercise which explains the concept of infinite loops.

"A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

An infinite loop in Ruby is of the form
```
loop do
end
```

Use an infinite loop and call the method _coder.practice_ within it and break if _coder.oh_one?_ is true.

_break_ if conditions in Ruby are of the form

```
if <condition>
  break
end
```
or a one-liner
```
break if <condition> 
```
