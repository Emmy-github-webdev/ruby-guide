This challenge has a beautiful one-liner answer.

"A hacker practices on HackerRank until getting to a rating of O(1) read as (Oh-one)"

Call the method _coder.practice_ until _coder.oh_one?_ becomes _true_.

Use the until control structure.

until is the logical equivalent of while not.

### Hint

```
while not <condition>
  <code>
end
```
Or

```
until <condition>
  <code>
end
```

or the beautiful one-liner
```
<code> until <condition>  
```
